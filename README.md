# Word-Counter

This is a 2 version Python 3 script for quantitive analysis of txt files. The script creates a dictionary with all the unique words that appear in the text, it returns the most common words in the text file and their count and it also give the ability to search for one or more specific words in the txt and see their count. Both versions count words seperated by hyphen as one. One version was made for time efficiency and the second for memory efficiency.

# Word_Counter_Time:

A time efficient algorithm that allows to search in large amount of data in a short time.

# Word_Counter_Memory:

A memory efficient algorithm. Time efficiency is considered here but more emphasis is given on memory efficiency. This is done to deal with large files and to minimize memory leaks.
This version also has a few extra features. Namely:

-Searching for words that are bigger than a specified length

-Adding excluded words specified by the user that the script will ignore and not count.

-Simple progress bar
